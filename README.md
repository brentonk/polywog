polywog
=======

`polywog` is an R package by [Brenton Kenkel](http://www.bkenkel.com/) and
[Curtis Signorino](http://www.rochester.edu/college/psc/signorino/) containing
routines for flexible functional form via basis regression with
oracle-penalized model selection.  You can install the most recent stable
version of the package
[from CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/polywog/index.html) by
running

```r
install.packages("polywog")
```

in an R console.

Flexible Functional Form Estimation"](http://www.rochester.edu/College/gradstudents/bkenkel/data/basics.pdf)
