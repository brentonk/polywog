============================================================


polywog 0.3-0 (2013-01-09)
--------------------------

* polywog() now has argument 'unpenalized' to exclude some terms from the
  adaptive LASSO penalty

* bootPolywog() now has argument 'maxtries' to control failure when a
  non-collinear bootstrap model matrix cannot be found

* bootPolywog() now has argument 'min.prop' to ensure a minimum amount of
  variation in the bootstrapped response variable in binary models

* The 'fitted.values' element of "polywog" objects is now on the response scale
  instead of the link scale (i.e., transformed to probabilities when family =
  "binomial")

* Fixed bug where the 'polywog.fit' element of cv.polywog() output would not
  contain fitted values

* Fixed bug that sometimes caused predVals() to fail unexpectedly


polywog 0.2-0 (2012-06-26)
--------------------------

* New function cv.polywog() to select both the polynomial degree and the
  penalization parameter by cross-validation

* New method margEff.polywog() to compute observation-wise and average marginal
  effects from a fitted model

* varNames element of a "polywog" object is now a character vector rather than a
  list (and is generated more safely)

* "polyTerms" attribute of matrix returned by polym2() is now a matrix rather
  than a data frame

* predict.polywog() now works correctly when newdata is a model frame


polywog 0.1-0 (2012-05-12)
--------------------------

* Initial release
