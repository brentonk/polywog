============================================================


polywog 0.4-0
-------------

* k-fold cross-validation can now be performed in parallel for adaptive LASSO
  models, controlled via the `.parallel` argument of `polywog()`.  Parallel
  computation of bootstrap iterations is now handled via the `.parallel`
  argument of `bootPolywog()` or `control.bp()`.

* Adds `model.matrix` and `model.frame` methods for objects of class
  `"polywog"`

* Polynomial expansions of the design matrix are now handled in C++, and
  obsolete functions `polym2()` and `rawpoly()` have been removed

* New arguments of `polywog()`:
    * `lambda`, `nlambda`, and `lambda.min.ratio` for finer control of the
      sequence of penalization factor values examined
    * `foldid` for direct specification of cross-validation folds (only
      available when fitting via the adaptive LASSO)
    * `thresh` and `maxit` for finer control of the convergence criterion,
      replacing old argument `scad.maxit`

* Package now requires version 1.9.5 or greater of `glmnet` (for parallel
  computation) and 2.4.0 or greater of `ncvreg` (fixed error in
  computing cross-validation folds)


polywog 0.3-0 (2013-01-09)
--------------------------

* polywog() now has argument 'unpenalized' to exclude some terms from the
  adaptive LASSO penalty

* bootPolywog() now has argument 'maxtries' to control failure when a
  non-collinear bootstrap model matrix cannot be found

* bootPolywog() now has argument 'min.prop' to ensure a minimum amount of
  variation in the bootstrapped response variable in binary models

* The 'fitted.values' element of "polywog" objects is now on the response scale
  instead of the link scale (i.e., transformed to probabilities when family =
  "binomial")

* Fixed bug where the 'polywog.fit' element of cv.polywog() output would not
  contain fitted values

* Fixed bug that sometimes caused predVals() to fail unexpectedly


polywog 0.2-0 (2012-06-26)
--------------------------

* New function cv.polywog() to select both the polynomial degree and the
  penalization parameter by cross-validation

* New method margEff.polywog() to compute observation-wise and average marginal
  effects from a fitted model

* varNames element of a "polywog" object is now a character vector rather than a
  list (and is generated more safely)

* "polyTerms" attribute of matrix returned by polym2() is now a matrix rather
  than a data frame

* predict.polywog() now works correctly when newdata is a model frame


polywog 0.1-0 (2012-05-12)
--------------------------

* Initial release
