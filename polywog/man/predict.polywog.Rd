\usage{
  \method{predict}{polywog} (object, newdata,
    type = c("link", "response"), interval = FALSE,
    level = 0.95, bag = FALSE, na.action = na.pass, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{a fitted model of class \code{"polywog"},
  typically the output of \code{\link{polywog}}.}

  \item{newdata}{an optional data frame containing
  observations for which fitted values should be computed.
  If not specified, fitted values are generated for the
  data used to fit the model.}

  \item{type}{specifies whether the fitted values should be
  generated on the link scale (\eqn{X \beta}) or in terms
  of the expected value of the response variable.  These
  only differ for binomial family models.}

  \item{interval}{logical: whether to calculate bootstrap
  confidence intervals for each fitted value.}

  \item{level}{confidence level for the intervals.}

  \item{bag}{logical: whether to use "bootstrap
  aggregation" to generate the main fitted values (if
  \code{FALSE}, they are calculated from the main model
  fit).}

  \item{na.action}{a function specifying what to do with
  observations in \code{newdata} containing \code{NA}s
  (default \code{\link{na.pass}}).  See "Details".}

  \item{...}{other arguments, currently ignored.}
}
\value{
  If \code{interval = TRUE}, a matrix containing each
  fitted value and its confidence interval.  Otherwise, a
  vector containing the fitted values.
}
\description{
  Generates fitted values, including bootstrap confidence
  intervals, for in- and out-of-sample data from a fitted
  polywog model.
}
\details{
  There are some special considerations involving elements
  of \code{newdata} that contain \code{NA}s.  If all
  estimated coefficients involving the variable \code{z}
  are exactly 0 (i.e., \code{z} is completely excluded from
  the estimated model), then it is still possible to
  generate a fitted value for an observation where \code{z}
  is not recorded.  Similarly, if all coefficients
  involving \code{z} are estimated as 0 in every bootstrap
  iteration, it is still possible to compute confidence
  intervals for such an observation.

  By default, \code{predict.polywog} computes fitted values
  and confidence intervals whenever it is possible to do
  so.  To compute these values only for fully complete
  cases in \code{newdata}, set \code{na.action =
  \link{na.omit}} or \code{na.action = \link{na.exclude}}.
  \code{na.omit} will return an object whose dimension
  equals the number of complete cases; \code{na.exclude}
  gives the same dimension as \code{newdata}, padded with
  \code{NA}s where appropriate.
