polywog 0.2-0 (2012-06-26)

* New function cv.polywog() to select both the polynomial degree and the
  penalization parameter by cross-validation

* New method margEff.polywog() to compute observation-wise and average marginal
  effects from a fitted model

* varNames element of a "polywog" object is now a character vector rather than a
  list (and is generated more safely)

* "polyTerms" attribute of matrix returned by polym2() is now a matrix rather
  than a data frame

* predict.polywog() now works correctly when newdata is a model frame
